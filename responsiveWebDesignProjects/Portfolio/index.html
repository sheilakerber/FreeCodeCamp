                <h2>Personal info</h2>
                <p>My name is Sheila Simone Kerber. I am a brazilian citizen borned in the city of Conc贸rdia, state of Santa Catarina. I left my homeborn city at the age of 18, when I moved to Florian贸polis (Santa Catarina's capital) to study. I lived there for around 12 years, and currently I moved back to Conc贸rdia, where I can enjoy more the company of my family. &#10084; </p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>While I lived in Florian贸polis, I took a major degree in Biological Sciences at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. It took me 7 years to finish my major, partly because I've always conciliated the studies with some part time internship, partly because a spend a year and a half in an academic exchange program at the United States. When I came back to Brazil, while after finishing my major, I took a Master's Degree in Biotechnology and Biosciences in the same university I majored. Currently I am learning web and systems development.</p>
                <h2>Did I gave up Biology?</h2>
                <p>No! I love biology, and I think it is an incredible field, with so much to discover. However, while I took my Master's Degree, I realized that the so called "academic life" may not be for me. I learned a lot at that time, became more independent with my tasks, and developed more my self organization skills, but I do not intend to keep my journey completely focused in this field.</p>

                <h2>Why I chose to learn web and systems development</h2>
                <p>
                    The first reason why I decided to learn web and systems development is due to the influence of some friends that work in this field. They convinced me that it is a great area to learn and grow professionaly. The second reason is that I can see a future where I can join my knowledge in Biology with systems development, specially in this Era of the Big Data.
