            <h2 class="titleSection">About Dr. Norman Borlaug's work</h2>
            <li>Borned in March 25 of 1914, Norman Ernest Borlaug was an American agronomist who studied plant pathology and genetics at the University of Minnesota between 1937 and 1942;
            </li>
            <li>His research focused primarily in the development of semi-dwarf, high-yield, and disease -resistant wheat varieties;
            </li>
            <li>Combined with modern agricultural prodution techniques, the wheat varieties produced by Borlaug were introduced (by himself) along the mid-20th century in Mexico, greatly improving its production and exportation by the country by 1963;
            </li>
            <li>With the same methodoloy applied in Mexico, Pakistan's and India's wheat yields nearly doubled between 1965 and 1970, improving considerably the food security of those nations.</li>
